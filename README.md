# Customer-Profiles-by-Clustering-Method

I analyzed the Customer Personality Analysis data set. The data was taken from Kaggle and included information about the ID,Year_Birth, Education, Marital_Status, Income, Kidhome, MntWines, MntFruits, MntMeatProducts	, MntFishProducts, MntSweetProducts, MntGoldProds, NumDealsPurchases, NumWebPurchases, NumCatalogPurchases, NumStorePurchased etc. The dataset consisted of 2240 rows and 29 columns.

The data was cleaned and prepared for analysis by removing missing values, null values, and unique values, changing the data type of the date, and time, checking for duplicates, and making new features. 

The aim of this project is to define the customer profiles by using this clustering method's result and give directions to the shopping personnel. In this way, marketing strategies will be planned clearly.

The analysis is based on the Total Spent and Income. By using Elbow Method, 5 type customer profiles are obtained. Customer profiles’ names are Cluster 0, cluster 1, cluster 2, cluster 3, cluster 4. 
•	Cluster 0 is low spending and average income, generally they have family and have 0-3 children and food consumption is low.
•	Cluster 1 is high spending and average income, they are alone and have family,0-1 children and meat-fish-fruit consumption is high. Also, they generally prefer store purchases.
•	Cluster 2 is average spending and average income; they generally have family and have 0-3 children. Food consumption is average, and fish is better than meat. Also, they generally prefer web purchases.
•	Cluster 3 is low spending and low income. Food consumption is low. They are alone & have family, if they are family have 0-2 children.
•	Cluster 4 is high spending and high income, generally they are alone. If they have a family of 0-2 children, they have. Wine shopping is a major preference. Also, food consumption is high.
